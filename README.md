# plushome

A modern, user-friendly home system for SMP servers â€“ with GUI support, teleport delay, and movement cancelation. This plugin provides a clean and intuitive way for players to manage their homes.

## Features
- **/home command** to open a beautiful, modern GUI.
- **Set and delete homes** easily through commands.
- **Configurable teleport delay** for fair gameplay.
- **Movement during the delay cancels teleportation**.
- **Supports multiple homes per player**, with limits configurable via permissions.

## Commands
- `/home` - Opens the home GUI for managing and teleporting to homes.
- `/sethome <name>` - Sets a home at your current location.
- `/delhome <name>` - Deletes a home.

## GUI
The `/home` command opens a GUI where players can:
- **View all their homes:** Each home is represented by a blue bed.
- **Teleport to a home:** Simply click on a home to start the teleportation.
- **Delete a home:** Shift-click on a home to delete it.

## Permissions
- `plushomes.use` - Allows a player to use the `/home`, `/sethome`, and `/delhome` commands. (Default: `true`)
- `plushomes.set.multiple.<number>` - Allows a player to set up to `<number>` homes. For example, `plushomes.set.multiple.10` allows a player to set 10 homes. (Default: `op`)
